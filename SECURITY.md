# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, email the maintainers with:
- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Any proof-of-concept or relevant logs

We will acknowledge receipt within 7 days and provide a timeline for remediation once validated.
